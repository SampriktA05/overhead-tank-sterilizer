        <p class="para">i-OTS is an overhead tank sterilizer based on UV technology which kills or deactivates the bacteria and algae which are very
            hazardous causing many fungal infections and diseases. This sterilizer uses the solar power to charge and spread the UV light at
            specific time span set-up by us based on data observed.

        <p class="para">Our product is an UV-C-based disinfection systems designed for 
            chemical-free water and process media in storage tanks and tanks.
            i-OTS is used in closed tanks with static and fluctuating levels.
            It is often used for optimal UV radiation coverage.i-OTS irradiates 
            water and tank walls with UV-C radiation, inactivating existing microorganisms
            and germs, and suppressing further microbial growth. these UV systems are a safe 
            and reliable solution for disinfection and also sterilizes the entire container
            interior and forms an effective barrier against bacterial contamination via container 
            ventilation. UV-C radiation inactivates microorganisms based on the interaction of electromagnetic 
            wavelengths with DNA, making them vulnerable to UVC radiation. If necessary, disinfectants like hydrogen peroxide or
            ozone can be combined with UV-C radiation for photochemical decomposition without harmful residues.
